  * Colour Scheme
    1. All text for the quiz is white #ffffff as it stands out against the background ensuring excellent readability. A semi-transparent box contains the quiz itself using rgba (3, 18, 114, 0.3) overlapping the dark background image, ensuring excellent readability. 
  * Typography
    1. The Nova Square font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is the main font used throughout the Quiz with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. The futuristic appearance of the font was chosen as it perfectly matched the science fiction subject matter.
    
* Imagery
    1. The main background image is designed to attract new users to the Quiz with its other worldly image.
    2. The main background image used for the quiz is from [pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) with a Free to use license.

The start page invites the user to begin the game. The background image draws the users attention with the eye catching image displaying a sci fi theme. This immediately conveys the subject of the site.
When the user clicks on the Start Button, they are taken to the question and answers screen. The white text and the same background image, with transparent overlay box are used on all three pages and provide continuity throughout the quiz pages.
### Questions and Answers Page

This page provides a single question and multiple choice options for the answer with four answer buttons. 
On click of the mouse the user makes their selection by selecting one of the answer buttons, they are then provided with instant feedback that informs them if the answer is correct or not.  This is shown with the correct button being highlighted green and all the correct answers highlighted red. The user is remined of their own selection because the selected button has a clear orange border. 
The user is then presented with the next button underneath the answers that allows them to proceed to the next question.
The users progress through the game is also displayed towards the bottom of the screen, e.g. Question 1 of 10, notifying the user what question they are on and the total number of questions.
