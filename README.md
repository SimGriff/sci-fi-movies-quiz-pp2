    1. All text for the quiz is white #ffffff as it stands out against the background ensuring excellent readability. A semi-transparent box contains the quiz itself using rgba (3, 18, 114, 0.3) overlapping the dark background image, ensuring excellent readability. 
  * Typography
    1. The Nova Square font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is the main font used throughout the Quiz with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. The futuristic appearance of the font was chosen as it perfectly matched the science fiction subject matter.
    
* Imagery
    1. The main background image is designed to attract new users to the Quiz with its other worldly image.
